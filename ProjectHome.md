This is my solution for a remote desktop for free, called SRD 1.0.1 (Simple Remote Desktop). SRD was written originally in the fall 2007 semester as a final project for my class at school named SRD 1.0.0 which is in <a href='http://www.programmersheaven.com/download/54877/download.aspx'> here</a> .

At the time, it was implemented using java RIM rather than Spring RMI and there were some difficulties to execute it for you. You will see why the implementation has been switched from Java RMI to Spring RMI from the [Java\_RMI\_Issues](Java_RMI_Issues.md) page.

Now it uses Spring RMI, so there are no difficulties like before. No need to get a plugin for RMI to make the execution easier even for the developers.

[Table\_Of\_Content](Table_Of_Content.md) is the first place to see the application and also as a introduction, you will see how it looks like from the below figure. You have a chance to see the research paper for the final project as a reference which is in Links tab on your right side.

Just download,play with it and make it better together !!

Thank you
