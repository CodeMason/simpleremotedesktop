 #  <b>What does SRD stand for ?</b>
     It stands for Simple Remote Desktop.<p/>
 #  <b>What's the goal of SRD ?</b>
     The primary goal is to make remote desktop users and Java RMI developers easier to 
     run,use and develop.<p/>
 #  <b>What's the current version of SRD ?</b>
     The current version of SRD is SRD 1.0.1.<p/>
 #  <b>After downloading SRD, it doesn't start but get some errors.Is my installation 
     correct ?</b>
     Please make sure that you have the three requirements, Java 1.5+,Spring framework 
     and Java Media Framework on the classpath.And then, you'll be all set.<p/>
 #  <b>I'm a Mac user and want to use SRD on my Mac. Are there any restrictions for only 
     Mac users regarding to the keyboard ?</b>
     Yes, there are some restrictions for Mac users. Since Mac has some special keys on 
     their keyboards such as option,apple keys. These keys are not assigned on SRD.<p/>
 #  <b>SRD uses video broadcasting technology using Java Media Framework. It sounds 
     like that CPU gets busy to do the job. What if I use an old PC to use SRD ?</b>
     SRD does use JMF to handle desktop screen. Because of the technology choice, old 
     PCs'CPUs get high usage and you will get some time lag.<p/>
 #  <b>Why should I use SRD rather than other well-known remote desktop applications?</b>
     It is true that there are well-known remote desktop applications out there, but they 
     don't try to make users use those applications easily. Their technologies are great 
     for developers but not for users. they are not user friendly enough. Here SRD comes 
     into play.<p/>
 #  <b>I want to use Mac as the server and Linux as the client. Is this configuration 
     correct ? Or is there any restrictions for the configuration ?</b>
     Technically, there are no restrictions and SRD runs on any OSes which supports Java. 
     But here is the thing. If you use Mac sa the server, you would get some errors about 
     jmf.jar file. You should avoid the configuration right now. Later it would be 
     changed.<p/>
 #  <b> Where do I get help ?</b>
     There are 3 ways for you to get help. One is google group, named Simple Remote 
     Desktop, and two is IRC and three is email me your questions.<p/>
 # <b>How do I report bugs ?</b>
     Please report bugs that you find to Issue section on google code.<p/>
 # <b>I am new to Java and don't know  how to run SRD using java -jar command. Is 
     there easier way to run SRD rather than jar file ?</b>
     Yes , there is a way to accomplish your question. The technology called JNLP which 
     enables you to run SRD with one click. SRD is having the feature soon as SRD 1.0.2. 
     Please wait for the time.<p/>
 # <b>I hear that JMF has a lot of potentiality but Sun doesn't care much about the 
     framework. Is SRD going to use the technology or change the implementation ?</b>
     You are correct about JMF. Right now Sun cares a lot more about media framework for 
     mobile phones rather than JMF and JMF is almost dead with a lot of potentiality. In 
     the near future, yes, SRD is going to stay with the framework, but the 
     implementations could be changed later depending on how effective it is for the 
     users.<p/>
 # <b>I understand that SRD is still version 1.0.1. I want to request some features on 
     SRD. How do I request them to you ?</b>
     You request new features using google group, IRC chat or email. Alternatively, if 
     you are a Java developer, you would be able to add some features and show us what 
     kind of features you add and you are on.<p/>
 # <b>SRD suggests that you start the server first and the the client. What if I start 
     the client first and then the server ?</b>
     You would get an error right now since the client trys connecting to the server to 
     use the services on the server side. If the client notices that the server is down 
     and can't get the services, the client stops working and returns an error. This is 
     going to be fixed, but right now please follow the order.<p/>
