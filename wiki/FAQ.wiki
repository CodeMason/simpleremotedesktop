 #1 <b>What does SRD stand for ? </b>
    It stands for Simple Remote Desktop.
 #2 <b>What's the goal of SRD ? </b>
    The primary goal is to make remote desktop users and Java RMI developers easier to
    run,use and develop. 
 #3 <b>What's the current version of SRD ? </b>
    The current version of SRD is SRD 1.0.1.
 #4 <b>Where do I get help ?</b>
    There are 3 ways for you to get help. One is google group, named Simple Remote  
    Desktop, and two is IRC and three is email me your questions.
 #5 <b>How do I report bugs ?</b>
    Please report bugs that you find to Issue section on google code.
 #6 <b>I am new to Java and don't know  how to run SRD using java -jar command. Is there easier way to run SRD rather than jar file ?</b>
    Yes , there is a way to accomplish your question. The technology called JNLP which 
    enables you to run SRD with one click. SRD is having the feature soon as SRD 1.0.2. 
    Please wait for the time.
 #7 <b>I hear that JMF has a lot of potentiality but Sun doesn't care much about the framework. Is SRD going to use the technology or change the implementation ?</b>
    You are correct about JMF. Right now Sun cares a lot more about media framework for 
    mobile phones rather than JMF and JMF is almost dead with a lot of potentiality. In 
    the near future, yes, SRD is going to stay with the framework, but the 
    implementations could be changed later depending on how effective it is for the users.
 #8 <b>I understand that SRD is still version 1.0.1. I want to request some features on 
    SRD. How do I request them to you ?</b>
    You request new features using google group, IRC chat or email. Alternatively, if you 
    are a Java developer, you would be able to add some features and show us what kind of 
    features you add and you are on.
 #9 <b>SRD suggests that you start the server first and the the client. What if I start 
    the client first and then the server ?</b>
    You would get an error right now since the client trys connecting to the server to 
    use the services on the server side. If the client notices that the server is down 
    and can't get the services, the client stops working and returns an error. This is 
    going to be fixed, but right now please follow the order.
