<h2>Result of the experiments with SRD:</h2>
 * How long SRD takes to move mouse
 * How long SRD takes to type characters
 * How long SRD takes to transfer file using Drag and Drop
 * How much SRD uses network resource

<h2>The results of actions on SRD</h2>
Actions include moving mouse,typeing characters and file transfers using drag and drop.

 <table border="1">
 <tr>
   <th><b> Each Action </b></th><th><b> Time (sec) </b></th>
 </tr> 
 <tr>
   <td> Moving mouse </td><td> 0.12 </td>
 </tr> 
 <tr>   
   <td> Typing characters </td><td> 0 (infinitely close to zero)</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
   <td> File transfer (size:61.4 KB) </td><td>7.45</td>
 </tr> 
 <tr>
  <td> File transfer (size:4.94 MB) </td><td>331.086</td>
 </tr>
 </table>

<h2> The results of network resource on SRD</h2>
Network resource includes downloads and uploads when the client and server in the initial state and when they are in actions.

*The server and the client are in the initial state.*

The first through fourth columns are on client and the fifth through eighth columns are on server and the first row is downloads and the second row is uploads.

   </tr>
 </table>

*The server and the client are just connected each other.* 

The first through fourth columns are on client and the fifth through eighth columns are on server and the first row is downloads and the second row is uploads.

*The server and the client talk each other typing characters,clicking mouse,moving mouse wheel.*

The first through fourth columns are on client and the fifth through eighth columns are on server and the first row is downloads and the second row is uploads.
